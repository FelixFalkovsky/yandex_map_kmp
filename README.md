# YandexMap Integration

This project includes an implementation of YandexMap using Kotlin Multiplatform, providing a seamless mapping experience across different platforms. Below are some key features and instructions on how to get started with it.

## Features

- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Leverage the power of Kotlin to write shared code that targets multiple platforms.
- **Clustering**: Efficiently manage and display a large number of markers on the map by grouping them into clusters, providing a cleaner and more user-friendly interface.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have all dependencies installed and properly configured for Kotlin Multiplatform support.
   
2. **Initialize the Map**: Use the provided API to initialize and display the YandexMap in your application view.

   ```kotlin
   // Kotlin code snippet for initializing the map
   val mapView = MapView(this)
   mapView.initialize { map ->
       // Additional map setup code here
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Clustering**: Take advantage of the clustering feature to manage and display a large set of map markers.
   
   ```kotlin
   // Kotlin code snippet for adding clusters
   val clusterManager = ClusterManager(mapView.context, mapView.map)
   clusterManager.addItems(markers)
   ```
